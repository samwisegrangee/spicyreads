        <h2>Hi I'm End</h2>
        <p>I retired after seventeen years in the first grade trenches in Allegan, Michigan.  Now you will find me doing my own writing, volunteering with students in several different places, doing freelance work, selecting books for various committees, and, of course, reading. <br><br> I won a 2016 Outstanding People for Education award from the Allegan County School Board Association. I’m proud to be a Cool Teacher award winner for Grand Valley State University’s educational television station. <br><br> Over the years, I’ve taught a Graduate Young Adult Literature class, served on the Printz committee, the Caldecott committee, and many other book committees for the American Library Association. <br><br> I am a certified Reading Specialist, which has led to the publication of more than 45 curriculum guides for students of all ages for eight different publishers, most notably Houghton Mifflin’s Scientists in the Field series. <br><br> I founded the teen book review column for the Michigan Reading Association and now I am reviewing books for Horn Book magazine. <br><br> Please drop me a line with what you are reading; I always love hearing about books!</p>
